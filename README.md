## Description

Bebop Bounty is an e-commerce platform based on the classic anime Cowboy Bebop.  This project is a twist on the traditional buyer/seller Ebay like platform wherin Sellers are posting
their items and Buyers are seeking out the item.  Here the premise is flipped and Buyers are the ones posting and sellers are the ones looking to fulfill this request or "Bounty".

The project is built using React, Amazon AWS, PostgreSQL, Docker, Express.js, Firebase, Node.js. For state management we used React's useContext. For styling we used React styled components
and bootstrap.

## Wins and Improvements
   Our project, Bebop Bounty, comprises numerous interconnected components. Creating an engaging user experience, underpinned by a cohesive Cowboy Bebop theme, stands as a remarkable achievement. However, our accomplishments extend beyond aesthetics. The Postgres database and server form the bedrock of our project, enabling a seamless integration of various components. As for future improvements, our initial plans included a user-to-user messaging system. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, this feature ended up on the chopping block. Given more time, we believe that this feature would significantly enhance the application.
